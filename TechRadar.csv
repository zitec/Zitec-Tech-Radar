GitHub Copilot,assess,tools,TRUE,"GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that promises to automate repetitive code writing tasks, while also being able to generate small blocks of code based on context. Although we feel like using Copilot incurs some extra debugging time, the experience seems to be net positive and we're inclined to recommend its adoption at the company level given the reasonable pricing. Adoption progress documented in internal decision record ZDR-0005."
AWS Code Deploy,hold,tools,FALSE,"Given that we standardized the code deployment process around Kubernetes + GitLab CI or Azure DevOps Pipelines, AWS CodeDeploy is not longer necessary even for AWS-based projects."
